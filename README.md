This is an experiment to assess the quality of Large Language Models against a set of very specific tasks.

Tasks:
1. extract the list of questions from analysts attending a company's earning call.
2. TBD


TODOs:
* add timing information

Open questions:
* list of questions vs list of analysts? GPT-4-o does a pretty good job finding more than one question per analyst.
