Before we begin the Q&A session, it gives me great pleasure to hand it over to our Chief Execuve Officer, Carlos Abrams-Rivera for opening comments.
Over to you, Carlos.
Carlos Abrams-Rivera Chief Executive Office & Director, The Kraft Heinz Co.
Well thank you, Anne-Marie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. So, before we begin our Q&A I'd just like to provide some perspecve on our top obsession here at Kra Heinz, our consumers. And while we've seen a notable upck in consumer senment in the first quarter, there is a gap between high and low earners, which connues to remain wide. And it shows a clear and connued bifurcaon.
So, the lower income consumers are challenged with interest rates remaining high, gas prices elevated and savings dwindling. So, there's a clear pullback of restaurant spend by these lower earning households, especially restaurants and convenience stores. These consumers instead are looking for value as they prepare more meals at home. So, in contrast, there has been meaningful growth in travel

The Kra Heinz Company
Q1 2024 Earnings Call | May 1, 2024
and accordingly, an increase in hospitality and entertainment sales driven by the bounce back among the higher earners. And here at Kra Heinz we are there to meet the evolving needs and tastes of all consumers, whether they're looking for value in serving their family delicious meals at home or seeking culinary delights as they set out on new adventures. They can look to the iconic and trusted brands of Kra Heinz. So, for us it's about having brands that are accessible and available to everyone. And I believe we're well posioned to serve all of these consumers for three primary reasons. One, because we're bringing innovave food soluons and faster than ever before; two because we connue to renovate our core brands for today and tomorrow; and three, because we have the best team in the industry, full stop. We're on track to meet our goals of generang $2 billion incremental net sales from innovaon, and the world has taken noce, as we were recently named one of the world's top 50 Most Innovave Companies by Fast Company. But more importantly, we are expanding the choices we offer our consumers so that they don't have to sacrifice. Whether it's providing greater value through mulpacks, plant-based opons such as our newly released NotCo Mac & Cheese or expanding the choices in our iconic brands such as zero sugar Heinz Ketchup. Myself, I've been travelling around the world vising with our employees, and they are consumer obsessed. Their sense of ownership, collaboraon, and agility is so inspiraonal. I just want to say thank you to every one of them for their dedicaon. We are proud of our progress, but far from sasfied, as we connue focusing on serving those consumers and making life delicious for everyone. And with that I have Andre joining me, so let's open the call for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. Our first queson comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. You may proceed.
Andrew Lazar Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Thanks. Good morning, Carlos, and Andre.
Carlos Abrams-Rivera Chief Executive Office & Director, The Kraft Heinz Co. Morning.
Andre Maciel Executive Vice President & Global Chief Financial Officer, The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Andrew.

The Kra Heinz Company
Q1 2024 Earnings Call | May 1, 2024
Andrew Lazar Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks. It looks like KHC is sll losing share in North America Retail, though at a more modest pace recently. But in the ACCELERATE Plaorm specifically, your remarks call out holding or gaining share in about 55% of this plaorm. I guess, would you expect this percentage to be higher given the disproporonate allocaon of resources to this plaorm? I guess a litle more detail on share trends within ACCELERATE would be helpful.
And then, you menoned US restaurants soening a bit. Are you starng to see any of that on the flip side benefit at-home eang for your business? And if not, why would that be? Thanks so much.
Carlos Abrams-Rivera Chief Executive Office & Director, The Kraft Heinz Co.
Yeah. So thank you, Andrew, for your queson. Before I get into the ACCELERATE, let me just at least give you a view how I'm seeing the business perform so far. And if you look at the last five weeks, just to remove the noise of Easter, we actually have connued to see volume share improvement versus yearto-date, and we're holding dollar share at the same pace in the US. So that's at the macro level at the US for our company. Now, if you look at ACCELERATE Plaorms, we actually connue to outperform the other plaorms. So far, we are seeing flat dollar share and growing volume share by 0.2 points.
And now let me just break out the other two and then I'll go back to ACCELERATE. We are losing share in PROTECT plaorms as we connue to see the impact of the decline in SNAP benefits. At the same me, I'm actually prety excited about the renovaons we are seeing in these brands because we are going to connue to bring more consumer preference opons as we go through the year. In our BALANCE part of our porolio, we are losing share, but improving versus year to date, primarily driven by coffee.
Now, to your queson about ACCELERATE plaorms, there's a couple of big brands that are in there that I would like to unpack a litle more. If you think about our Mac & Cheese business, which is within the ACCELERATE plaorms, what you're going to be connuing to see is, one, we are going to start lapping a lot of the headwinds from SNAP. Mac & Cheese was probably one of the categories that was more impacted by SNAP. And as we go into Q2, beginning now in May, you'll see a plethora of new innovaons from gluten-free to new opons on flavors on our Mac & Cheese business, as well as some new and excing things for the category with some new SKUs that we're bringing in the second half of the year.
If you look at the other parts of our ACCELERATE Plaorm, that includes our condiments. And in the condiments side, what I would say is, our category actually is expanding. So, we are growing, and we're actually growing volume share. So, for us, how do we connue to drive this growth within the category that has the right tailwinds behind it? And you'll see us connue to expand on the number of offers and innovaons as we go through the year.
The one note that may be also helpful to understand in our ACCELERATE Plaorm is also we also got out some non-strategic business, in parcular, our Heinz bulk vinegar, which it was a business that, for us, in

The Kra Heinz Company
Q1 2024 Earnings Call | May 1, 2024
terms of economics, didn't make as much sense. So, we also exited that in the first quarter of the year. So hopefully that gives you a sense how we're thinking about ACCELERATE within the context of our company. I think the second part of your queson is on our Away from Home business. And I think, let me just say that right now, as I menoned in the prepared remarks, we are seeing some slowing of the restaurant traffic in the US, and some of it is impacng our business. But also some of the impact that we saw in the first quarter was due to us exing some low-margin businesses as we think about making the right choice for the overall P&L. The actual exit of the businesses was about $15 million in the first quarter, and that's going to be similar throughout the rest of the year. Now for us, we believe as we go forward, we actually believe that it's about us connuing to drive the importance in Away from Home in new channels. I menoned in the opening remarks that we're also seeing great opportunies in terms of travel and leisure. And that's an area where our teams are both focused because of not only growth, but also because it allows us to expand margins into those areas. And we also are seeing improvement in terms of distribuon of our core businesses as we go into Q3. So again, I feel very good about Away from Home. I think that the trends will connue to improve. And at the same me, for us at Kra Heinz, we have the scale to make sure that no mater where our consumers are shopping, at hotels, restaurants or at home, that we have the distribuon opportunity for us to kind of make sure that we are there to service anywhere they are.
Andrew Lazar Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Thanks very much.
Carlos Abrams-Rivera Chief Executive Office & Director, The Kraft Heinz Co. Thanks for the queson, Andrew.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for quesons. Our next queson comes from Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. You may proceed.
Ken Goldman Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi. Good morning. Thank you.

The Kra Heinz Company
Q1 2024 Earnings Call | May 1, 2024
Carlos Abrams-Rivera Chief Executive Office & Director, The Kraft Heinz Co.
Morning, Ken.
Ken Goldman Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. You menoned inflaon in your comments in a few areas. I guess two quesons here. First, I don't think you updated us. Forgive me if I missed it, but I think last me you were talking about maybe 3% cost inflaon for the year. I'm just curious if that's sll a reasonable number.
And then I guess, second, more broadly, there's been a lot of atenon paid to cocoa, obviously, but coffee inflaon's been fairly notable as well. And I'm just curious, right, even though historically coffee is somewhat of a pass-through category, do you think that if you or your competors need, you'll be able and even willing to raise prices to customers as much as you typically might have? Or do you maybe expect a litle more, I guess, pushback than usual?
Carlos Abrams-Rivera Chief Executive Office & Director, The Kraft Heinz Co.
Thank you, Ken, for the queson. Okay, let me start and then I'll ask Andre to connue to build on it. For us, we are certainly commited to connue to provide families with affordable opons. And that is something that we take very seriously. And if you think about 2023, we did end the year with 3% inflaon, but we only passed about 1% pricing to consumers. So, we did that very, very much intenonally in a way for us to make sure we are all doing everything we can to offset things so that consumers don't see it.
Now Andre, if you want to comment a litle more in terms of cost inflaon today in the coffee category.
Andre Maciel Executive Vice President & Global Chief Financial Officer, The Kraft Heinz Co.
Sure. Good morning, Ken. We sll expect inflaon to be in the low-single-digit territory like we said before. So, nothing has changed on that regard, with inflaon a bit more concentrated in Q2 and Q3 than in the other quarters. And that's primarily because of the big three commodies: cheese, meat, coffee, which we are seeing parcularly in meat and cheese a higher level of inflaon happen in Q2, Q3 as you are lapping very favorable comps from last year. So, we don't see any other meaningful change here. And the pricing we would be taking is very surgical and would be around those categories that have been suffering the largest impact.
And I'll say, cocoa, luckily, is not a relevant part of our porolio at all. I mean, a litle bit in the Netherlands. But beyond that, there's nothing worth menoning. And we don't see any reason to

The Kra Heinz Company
Q1 2024 Earnings Call | May 1, 2024
believe at this point that we would not be able to connue to pass through the prices in those commodity categories like it has always been the case.
Ken Goldman Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC All right. Thank you. And if I could ask a quick follow-up. Just the increase in gross margin guidance coupled with no other changes implies a bit higher SG&A than you previously expected. So just assuming that's accurate, are there any key areas in operang expenses we should think about that are maybe a litle bit higher than planned? Obviously not a huge amount, or maybe the plant shutdown is the primary, I guess, culprit here so to speak. Just trying to get a litle color there if we could.
Andre Maciel Executive Vice President & Global Chief Financial Officer, The Kraft Heinz Co. As you saw in CAGNY, we are starng to deploy our Brand Growth System, which is the method that will allow us to connue to improve in our markeng, connue to strengthen our brands. And one of the components of the Brand Growth System is ensure that you have the sufficient level of markeng across the porolio. And we're starng to see a few selected areas where we need to step up markeng investment, thinking on the long-term. And we have been gradually approving incremental investments on top of what we inially planned on the markeng side in parcular, which I think is a great thing for us. That's all.
Carlos Abrams-Rivera Chief Executive Office & Director, The Kraft Heinz Co. Thank you, Ken.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for quesons. Our next queson comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. You may proceed.
Bryan Spillane Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Hey, thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. I just had two quesons. One, just I guess a detail. Can you share with us - I think in the past you've shared with us how much the SNAP issue has impacted organic sales. So, do you have that for the first quarter?

The Kra Heinz Company
Q1 2024 Earnings Call | May 1, 2024
Andre Maciel Executive Vice President & Global Chief Financial Officer, The Kraft Heinz Co.
Look it's never 100% precise. We're talking about the macroeconomic model. But we esmate on the US retail business, in the range of 200 bps negave impact.
Bryan Spillane Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. And then queson on Away from Home in the US and the deceleraon, and again, you've quanfied the impact of the plant closure. But just can you give us a sense of how much of the impact of exing the customer. But can you give us a sense of just how much of the decline is also related to like traffic at restaurants? I'm just trying to get a sense of the weighng of what's actually driving the slowdown.
And then also, as you look into the second half, right, where you're expecng - there's an expectaon that there's going to be some recovery. Just what underpins that? And I say that in the context of as we're going through earnings season, a lot of the restaurants have incrementally goten worse or slower. So, just is there maybe too much opmism baked into the back half expectaon for a recovery when it looks like a lot of these restaurant companies are guiding down?
Carlos Abrams-Rivera Chief Executive Office & Director, The Kraft Heinz Co.
Let me start and then Andre, if you want to build on that. And thanks for the queson, Bryan. First of all, I connue to feel very good about our overall strategy globally about Away from Home. Again, it's a business that we are seeing connue to improve outside the US and even as we are seeing some of the slowing of the restaurant business here in the US.
If I think about the second half, there's a few things that I think we'll feel beter as we go into this rest of the year, even in the US here. First of all, we menoned about this factory impact that we had to close for unplanned maintenance. And that's going to affect us in Q2. And that will be behind us as we go into the second half of the year.
The second part is that we are also going to be expanding the number of clients in our porolio. So, there's number of things that I cannot speak to today, but that we'll see as we go into Q3 in which will actually expand the distribuon of our products.
And then the third part is that we are going to connue to drive the focus on us going into atracve higher-margin channels. So again, beyond the restaurants, in places like leisure, hospitality, and travel where we are actually seeing beter performance because of the higher income consumer and us geng into those channels in parcular. And I think within that channel we are seeing very successful programs

The Kra Heinz Company
Q1 2024 Earnings Call | May 1, 2024
around our Heinz Selecon program and hospitality experiences that allow us to bring differenated type of programs in an industry that, unl now, we really haven't played as strongly. So, and then lastly what I'll say is, this is an area where we're going to connue to drive innovaon in Away from Home. I mean, already you are seeing how we are taking our HEINZ REMIX machine, and we are actually using that and planning it to work in the partnership that we have with BurgerFi which is now our first restaurant to debut our HEINZ REMIX. And we're going to see that expanding as we go into 2024. So, the idea is not only the fact that we're going to be present, but we're also going to connue to be innovave in both the channel and the type of products we're going to bring into those channels. And Andre, anything else you want to talk about?
Andre Maciel Executive Vice President & Global Chief Financial Officer, The Kraft Heinz Co. I don't think so.
Carlos Abrams-Rivera Chief Executive Office & Director, The Kraft Heinz Co. Thanks for your queson, Bryan.
Bryan Spillane Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. All right. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for quesons. Our next queson comes from John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securies. You may proceed.
John Baumgartner Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC
Good morning. Thanks for the queson.
Carlos Abrams-Rivera Chief Executive Office & Director, The Kraft Heinz Co. Morning. Thanks.

The Kra Heinz Company
Q1 2024 Earnings Call | May 1, 2024
John Baumgartner Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC
Carlos, you highlighted consumer stress as a theme. And I wanted to ask in North America where the volume declines are sll more pronounced, things like Mac & Cheese, which you just detailed for Andrew, but also ketchup and juices, these are categories where private label's been underpenetrated historically. And now you're seeing volumes growing a bit. Are you seeing anything different, whether it is new merchandising by retailers or new price sensivity among consumers that's changing the dynamic in these categories at all? So, I'm curious for your take on the pockets of private label share growth.
And then maybe a follow-up. Are there any specific categories in US retail where you're expecng material benefits from joint business plans or a reinvestment for the duraon of this year?
Carlos Abrams-Rivera Chief Executive Office & Director, The Kraft Heinz Co.
Thank you for your queson. First on the private label, first of all, we are fortunate that we have such iconic and beloved brands in our porolio. And I think what you're seeing is that really we haven't seen much of a change in terms of our overall gaps versus private label. And I think for us, the benefit that we have had is that over the last two years, we have spent a significant amount of energy in connuing to renovate our porolio. And today we certainly have in the US renovated almost 100% of our porolio to make sure that it connues to be relevant for today and tomorrow.
And I think that, along with the fact that we are also very much focused on delivering great value to consumers. We have to make sure that as we think about value, that it's not just about the price point. It's also about it's worth paying for. So that's why our focus in driving quality products in a way that is affordable and giving more consumer choices, that is also driving the overall value equaon for consumers. So, what you're seeing in the data is private label has been gaining share. But really, they have stabilized and they're taking more share from other branded players.
In terms of our JBP, that connues to be a strength of ours. But frankly, it comes with the fact that we have been building this trust and partnership with our key retailers that allows us to truly leverage the scale of our total porolio in a way that helps us to both drive our distribuon of innovaon as well as improve our overall performance and execuon in-store. Because of these partnerships, we can do things in-store that probably other peers cannot do. Whether that's about the holiday season coming up now in the summer, we have the range in our porolio that allows us to create truly differenated and unique value promoons that other people cannot do. So, it's something that we connue to elevate and we connue to build on as we have strengthened our porolio and the partnerships we have with the key retailers.

Thanks, Carlos.
Carlos Abrams-Rivera Chief Executive Office & Director, The Kraft Heinz Co. Thanks for the queson.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for quesons. Our next queson comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.
Stephen Powers Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Yes, hey, good morning, guys. Thanks. Hey, Carlos, in the prepared remarks you talked about the unplanned maintenance that you had to take on one of your Away from Home plants. It seems that you've resolved that issue, and you expect the impacts to be isolated to the second quarter. But maybe just a litle bit more details on what transpired there. There any kind of root cause diagnosc? And then just do you expect that to be a prety quick bounce back and recovery in 3Q? Or is the recovery going to be more spread across the back half? Thank you.
Carlos Abrams-Rivera Chief Executive Office & Director, The Kraft Heinz Co. Yeah. Thank you for your queson, Steve. Yeah, listen, I wouldn't give you that much more informaon than I already shared. It was a temporary shutdown in our plant for that unplanned maintenance. Now that parcular factory was very much focused on our Away from Home business. And so those condiments are places that we cannot source from other places and much within our network of factories. So that's why, in parcular, it created a litle bit of a dissonance in the Q2 only. And Andre, if you want to give a litle more details on the impact in our - what we see in the range of the porolio for Q2.
Andre Maciel Executive Vice President & Global Chief Financial Officer, The Kraft Heinz Co. Yeah. So, as we said in prepared remarks, producon has resumed and is gradually going back towards the prior level. Not there yet, but producon has resumed and that's why I expect the impact to be - we do expect producon to be fully back on track within the quarter. And then the impact on top line, as we said, would be in the range of 50 to 100 bps to the total company growth which is a funcon of how fast we can really bring the producon fully up to speed.

Carlos Abrams-Rivera Chief Executive Office & Director, The Kraft Heinz Co. Thanks for the queson, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for quesons. Our next queson comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.
David Palmer Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Two quesons. Thanks. First, a follow-up on food service. What is your general food service assumpon going forward that underlies your mid-single-digit organic growth that you have planned for the year? Is that that you basically expect that current trends industry wide and globally will remain at a similar level that you saw in the first quarter or improving from there? And then secondly, just Oscar Mayer, and the beverage business, both were declining maybe mid-single digits or so in measured channels in the first quarter. Could you maybe talk about the challenges and general plans and prospects for improvement for each of those? Thanks very much.
Carlos Abrams-Rivera Chief Executive Office & Director, The Kraft Heinz Co. Thank you. Maybe Andre, if you can comment in Away from Home and maybe I can build on the Oscar Mayer and beverage business.
Andre Maciel Executive Vice President & Global Chief Financial Officer, The Kraft Heinz Co. Yes. So first, if you think about our second half, as we said, we expect to be on algo throughout the enre second half. And if you think about our three pillars of growth, first on Emerging Markets, as we said, Q1 came in line with what we said will happen, mid-single digit, primarily because of the shipment phasing in Brazil. So, as we head into Q2, we do expect Emerging Markets to be now very close or at our long-term algo and in the second half fully on the long-term algo. So that's - a point comes from that roughly, maybe a litle more. On the US Retail business as a funcon of industry improving gradually, volume connues to improve. All the innovaon, renovaon, Carlos menoned a few examples. We do expect to be, if not on algo, at least approaching algo. So that would be a big contributor for the improvement as we head into the second half.

The Kra Heinz Company
Q1 2024 Earnings Call | May 1, 2024
And then finally on Away from Home, we don't need to be fully on algo to deliver our numbers in the second half and that's not what we're contemplang. So, we don't expect Away from Home to be fully back on algo. Even though on the Internaonal side, we should be back there. In the US, where we think the dynamics of the industry is what gives us a pause. We do expect improvement, a gradual improvement on the industry plus the business wins.
But I mean, I think we're sll a bit of a pause to see how much of the industry will recover. But again, we don't need to be fully on algo in U.S. Away from Home to deliver our guidance for the second half.
Carlos Abrams-Rivera Chief Executive Office & Director, The Kraft Heinz Co.
And then, just going deeper on the Oscar Mayer and beverage quesons, David, what I would say, if you go back to our CAGNY presentaon, those are businesses that are in two different porolio roles within our company. So, our beverage business is within our PROTECT business in which we actually are allocang resources in order to protect the profitability through the renovaon across those brands to drive the growth.
So, if you think about some of the key brands there, you'll see that our MiO liquid concentrate in which we actually just renovated our enre design or product. We have a new campaign, a markeng campaign focused on the wellness that the brand can offer.
If you think about Crystal Light, we just debuted our first major innovaon in 10 years, and we're launching a number of new and excing funconal benefits. For us it's about how do we connue to drive that sense of focus and renovang of those parcular products? Because we know they're differenated and we think they are well posioned for the long term.
And Oscar Mayer is part of our BALANCE business, which, again, we are making sure we're making the right investments in order to protect our distribuon. And at the same me we also are being thoughul about how we are going to manage a business that is very exposed to the commodity side of things.
So, we are being also thoughul of making sure we are protecng the top line while at the same me making sure we have the right gross margin management in order for us to make it work within the enre Kra Heinz porolio.
Andre Maciel Executive Vice President & Global Chief Financial Officer, The Kraft Heinz Co.
Yeah. The only think I would add on the BALANCE porolio as a whole. You saw in prepared remarks that the overall the BALANCE declined 4% in the quarter, but the gross profit dollars grew 5%. So, as we have said before, we connue to - it's a balancing act, and we connue to make sure that we don't starve those brands of the core investments to sustain their business. But we should not expect, on average, growth coming from there.

Operator: Thank you. One moment for our last queson. Our last queson comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. You may proceed.
Robert Moskow Analyst, TD Cowen
Hi. Thanks for the queson. Andre, I think you might have already answered this, but mathemacally, I think the guidance now for food service, it implies a 50 basis point reducon to the overall company compared to, I think, the high-single-digit guidance you had last quarter. So, does the rest of the porolio need to offset that? Are you expecng anything to be a litle beter than you expected? Or is it just absorbed? And then secondly, I think the slides said that you're seeing improvement in retail trends in US Retail. And maybe that's just versus year ago. But can I assume that, despite the market share being down versus year ago, do you need to make any adjustments to your markeng plan for 2024? Is there any increased price investment or adversing investment that needs to be made that's different from what you expected? Thanks.
Carlos Abrams-Rivera Chief Executive Office & Director, The Kraft Heinz Co. Andre, you want to start with Away from Home, and I can comment on the retail trends?
Andre Maciel Executive Vice President & Global Chief Financial Officer, The Kraft Heinz Co. Yeah. So, good morning, Rob. First, as you said, the 50 bps that we menoned in prepared remarks, I should be clear, is linked - the 50 to 100 bps due to plant shutdown and is focused on the second quarter. So, we do not expect impact from that as we go into the second half. So, as we head into the second half, as I said before, we do expect Emerging Markets to be fully back on algo. We do expect the

The Kra Heinz Company
Q1 2024 Earnings Call | May 1, 2024
US Retail, North America Retail to connue to improve, like it improved in Q1. We expect it to improve more in Q2 and then more in the second half. As a funcon, again, of lapping SNAP and a lot of contribuon from innovaon and renovaon.
And on Away from Home, we do expect the rest of the world to gradually improve and get close, if not on algo. And then the US becomes then the queson where we don't need to be at mid-single digits in the second half for us to achieve our guidance. But we do expect a gradual improvement of industry. And I think we have seen that from different sources as well. I think that there is a general expectaon of that. Together with all the business wins that we have done, and that we're going to be past the situaon with the plant as we head into the second half.
Carlos Abrams-Rivera Chief Executive Office & Director, The Kraft Heinz Co.
Thank you, Andre. On the retail trends, I guess I'll go back to the point at the beginning, which is we are seeing volume share improvements versus the last five weeks with the year-to-date. So, we are seeing that the momentum is happening already. And for us, what we are going to be doing is focusing on those things we can control, which is as you go into the year to go, you'll see us connue to drive the renovaon of our brands. Like I menoned, whether it's in our PROTECT plaorms, in our ACCELERATE, which is driving more innovaon as you'll see now in Q2, and will connue to step up through the rest of the year. And then be smart in our markeng investments.
Andre menoned earlier that part of the reason we're taking some of those gross margin dollars and invesng back in the business is because now we are deploying a Brand Growth System that allows us to think about how do we make sure we're being smart about where to spend and places that maybe we haven't been spending at sufficient levels. So you are, in fact, going to see that connued focus on us driving the right dollars against the right priories for us to drive the retail growth. And thank you for the queson, Rob.
