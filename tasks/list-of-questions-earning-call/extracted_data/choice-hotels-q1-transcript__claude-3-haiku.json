    "question": "If I could, for Scott or Pat, would love to just kind of run through a little bit on the cash flow side. So we've talked a lot about investments across the platform, obviously what you're doing to drive the revenue intense strategy. We're getting a lot of questions around sort of the free cash flow conversion and free cash flow bridge. So specifically, I just want to drill in a little bit more. If you could help us kind of think through the major buckets, what's your expectation for key money that's going into some of the franchise support side, what's the expected investment for Cambria. And then I think third and most important, we're seeing a pretty big set of just pure CapEx and would love to kind of understand a little bit more about is that the platform that you're investing in? Or what's driving that? Because it is pretty high relative to a lot of your peers in the asset-light hospitality space?"

    "question": "Just can you add some color on the reservation income that you guys record and help us understand the mismatch between the reimbursable line items on the income statement versus what gets added back in the EBITDA reconciliation. It looks like you got about $12 million of earnings in the first quarter. Any one-timers in there? Is that the right run rate? And then what's assumed in your full year guide would be helpful."

    "question": "You mentioned that your capital allocation priorities are unchanged, and you just talked about this a little bit. But I think you had mentioned that you were willing to take up the leverage to a degree now that you're not pursuing the Wyndham transaction. Can you just remind us maybe where you are, where that could go and how you think about buyback versus other areas of investment?"

    "question": "Number one, I know you sort of talked about RevPAR. But could you maybe give us a bit more insight about RevPAR cadence for the remainder of the year, whether that's exactly or relative or qualitative as possible. And then my follow-up is, post the endeavors with Wyndham, were there or are there any opportunities that may have been on hold that may be coming back to life or becoming more active now that you've moved on from that."

    "question": "I wonder if you could tell us if you're still expecting a full year increase in total units. I know the revenue-intense units, it sounds like your view on that is unchanged. Just wondering what's happening outside of that segment? And then also, can you help us think about how to size the opportunity of the Park Inn by Radisson where you think that could (inaudible), on a full year basis in '25. And you kind of alluded to -- you referenced you potentially still looking at acquisitions, I think. So I wonder if you could just clarify that a little bit more. You kind of made the comment, I think, more having to do with your leverage levels."

    "question": "A couple of quick questions here. Looking at your 2024 guidance, what's embedded for royalty fee growth this year? Can that match the level of EBITDA growth? Or does it lag? And then I have a follow-up."

    "question": "My first question, then I'll have a follow-up question. Pat, would you completely rule out trying again for Wyndham and sort of lay out a scenario here. Let's say Wyndham stock a year from now is still hovering at $75. And we all know they've laid out a plan sort of in defense to your proposed acquisition to organically get their stock at least to $90 or above. But hypothetically, if the stock was still at $75 a year from now would you try again for Wyndham? Or because of concern -- hovering concerns around FTC and Department of Justice and all that, would that not be something you would be interested in, in that scenario? I'm just trying to see if it's something at this point you would completely rule out if that were the case, say, a year from now? On your earnings, it looks like your other revenue line was up materially year-over-year. Can you talk about what drove that? I think it was up 55% year-over-year. I know in the past, when we've seen outsized growth that's from termination fees. Just a little bit more color on that and then expectations for that revenue line item for the rest of the year."

    "question": "The first one, just on the reimbursed revenue and cost dynamic. It's slightly different. IHG has had something slightly similar in that quarter, but it is a slightly different methodology to some of your peers in terms of the accounting for other fee types and suggest that you're not going to be running that line item to break even. Is that going to move into a different line in terms of where you account for those revenues. And the revenues or the kind of permanent gains, the $8 million to $10 million a quarter that you talked about, do they come into your guidance of mid-singledigit royalty rate increases because you're kind of (inaudible) permanent net revenue that you got to keep? Your -- obviously a big part of that pipeline increase came from the rooms that you signed in France. Could you just talk about the economics of that deal? Is that a kind of (inaudible) conversion deal? What's the source specifically of the sort of owners of those properties? And how does kind of fee stream and key money going into any brand changes or property changes working?"
